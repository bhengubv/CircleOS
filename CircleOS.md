# CircleOS Has Moved

CircleOS has been spun out into its own repository to accommodate the large AOSP codebase (100+ GB when built).

**New Repository:** https://github.com/bhengubv/CircleOS

## What is CircleOS?

Privacy-first Android mobile operating system based on AOSP, designed for:
- Privacy by default (network permissions, scoped storage/contacts)
- Community defense with anonymous threat sharing
- Mesh networking capabilities
- Malware containment (Lobby & Jail)
- Honest security tiers for different devices

## Why the move?

CircleOS will grow to 100+ GB once AOSP source code is included. Keeping it in the dataacuity monorepo would bloat the BI/data platform repository unnecessarily.
