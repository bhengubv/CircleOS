# Privacy Policy

## 1. What we collect

When you join the Circle OS waitlist:
- Email address
- Phone model
- Country

When you submit a support ticket:
- Information you choose to include (device model, OS version, description)
- Your email if you choose to provide it

**Nothing else.** No cookies (except functional session cookies). No tracking pixels. No advertising networks.

---

## 2. What we don't collect

- Location data
- Device identifiers or fingerprints
- Browsing history or behaviour
- Usage data from the Circle OS operating system
- Advertising identifiers
- Data from third-party social logins

---

## 3. The operating system

Circle OS itself collects no telemetry by default. There is no phone-home. Crash reports are opt-in, anonymised before transmission, and contain no personal information.

---

## 4. On-device data

All Circle OS data (Butler conversations, Titanium wallet, mesh messages, privacy logs) stays on your device. It is never transmitted without your explicit action.

---

## 5. Third parties

We use no advertising networks, no analytics that track individuals, and no social media SDKs. If we use privacy-respecting analytics (e.g. Plausible), it collects aggregate page view counts only — no personal data, no cookies.

---

## 6. Data retention

Waitlist data is retained until you request deletion or until one year after Circle OS public launch, whichever comes first. Support tickets are retained for 12 months.

---

## 7. Your rights (POPIA)

Under the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (South Africa), you have the right to:
- Access personal information we hold about you
- Correct inaccurate information
- Request deletion of your information
- Object to processing

To exercise these rights, email **info@thegeek.co.za**. We respond within 5 business days.
