# First Boot

Your phone is starting Circle OS for the first time. Here's what to expect.

---

## What you'll see

First boot takes **3–6 minutes**. The Circle OS logo will appear and the system will optimise apps in the background. This is normal — don't power off the phone.

---

## Setup wizard

After the first boot completes, you'll see the setup wizard.

### Step 1: Language and region

Select your language and region. Circle OS uses this for time zone, date format, and Butler context.

### Step 2: Wi-Fi (optional)

Connect to Wi-Fi to download SleptOn apps and receive OTA updates. You can skip this — Circle OS works fully offline.

### Step 3: Personality Mode

Choose your starting mode. You can change this at any time.

| Mode | Best for |
|------|---------|
| **Standard** | Everyday use — balanced |
| **Private** | Maximum privacy — all identifiers faked |
| **Power Saver** | Extended battery — reduced background activity |
| **Butler Focus** | Maximises AI performance |

Don't overthink it. Start with **Standard**.

### Step 4: Butler introduction

Butler introduces itself. It will ask if you'd like to enable local voice input. This is optional and never sends audio off-device.

### Step 5: Network permission

Circle OS uses a **default-deny internet policy**. Every new app starts with no internet access. You grant it app-by-app.

You'll be asked which pre-installed apps should have internet access.

!!! tip
    You can always change this in **Circle Settings → Privacy → Network Permissions**.

---

## After setup

Once setup is complete, you're in. Here's what to do next:

1. **Open SleptOn** to install your apps.
2. **Check the Mesh** — if other Circle OS devices are nearby, they'll appear automatically.
3. **Set up Titanium** — open the Titanium app to create your Shongololo wallet.
4. **Try Butler** — ask it anything.

## Dual boot users

If you installed Circle OS in Slot B, you can switch back to Android at any time:

1. Power off the phone.
2. Hold **Power + Volume Down** during boot.
3. Select **Slot A (Android)**.

Or from inside Circle OS: **Settings → System → Reboot to Android**.
