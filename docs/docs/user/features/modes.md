## Per-mode settings

Each mode controls:

- Notification filtering (which apps can interrupt you)
- Privacy level (how aggressive identifier spoofing is)
- Butler personality (tone and focus)
- Display (brightness, dark mode, text size)
- Network (WiFi only, mesh priority)
- Battery (performance vs saver)

- Time of day
- Location (home vs work vs unknown)
- Calendar events
- Connected devices (car Bluetooth = Drive mode)

Enable: **Circle Settings → Modes → Butler Context Detection → On**
