## What is Circle OS?

Circle OS is a privacy-first Android-based operating system. It replaces the software on your phone with something faster, more private, and built for real life.

**What you get:**

- No Google tracking or telemetry
- Butler AI that runs entirely on your device
- Mesh networking — stay connected when the internet goes down
- Titanium wallet — tap-to-pay without internet
- Automatic data compression
- SleptOn — a private app store

**What you keep (with dual boot):**

- Your original Android installation in Slot A
- All your banking apps
- Google Play access when you need it

## Before you start

## Dual boot vs clean install

You have two options:

=== "Dual Boot (Recommended)"
    Installs Circle OS in Slot B. Your original Android stays in Slot A. Reboot to switch between them.

    **Best for:** Most users. Zero risk. Keep banking apps.

=== "Clean Install"
    Replaces your entire OS with Circle OS. More storage available. Simpler setup.

    **Best for:** Developers and privacy-focused users who don't need banking apps.
